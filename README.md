# alura-nodeJS-mongoDB
This repository is part of the Warm Up related to the Software Architecture graduate course

I'll assume you have the nodeJS installed and have already set the mongoDB atlas

After that you can run inside the project root folder:

`npm install`

To run the project execute the command bellow in the root page

`DATABASE_USER={db_name} DATABASE_PASSWORD={db_password} DATABASE_NAME={db_name} npm run dev`
